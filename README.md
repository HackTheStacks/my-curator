# AMNH Curator

The goal of the AMNH Curator project is to more directly connect researchers and librarians with patrons through exploration and deeper discovery of physical artifacts. Once downloaded, our mobile application consistently listens for beacons that are connected to physical artifacts in the museum. When a patron steps near a beacon they'll receive a phone notification and a list of additional resources and details about the item itself.

On the backend, curators--in the form of librarians, visiting scholars, and staff at the library--will (soon) be able to upload a link and a brief snippet detailing what makes them most passionate about the their work that will be parsed to create an appealing application tidbit. In this way, we hope to connect the little stories that stick out to the enthusiastic scholars at the museum.
